This project represents my first full-stack web app.

The front-end will be built using React 18; back-end to be built using Node/ express.

This will be a social media app for coffee lovers, where the user can 'check in' their daily cup, view their feed by friends' checkins, global checkins, and local checkins, and toast/ comment on friends' checkins. Think untappd but for coffee . . .
