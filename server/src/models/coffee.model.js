        description: "Old Dank Nic, one of our annual holiday blends, is back! For this coffee we are using a Catuai from Guatemala that has been fermented with Cocoa mucilage to create a sweet, fudgy base. We paired this with two natural processed coffees, a Mixed lot from Nicaragua and a Bourbon from El Salvador, to add punchy, red-fruit acidity to the cup."

This cup shines with sweet, deep notes of pomegranate molasses and cranberry sauce. Dial in with a 1:16 brew ratio, filtered water at 208-210℉, a medium grind, and a 3-3.5 minute brew cycle. "

This iteration is a combo of natural Honduras, natural Ethiopia, and Bourbon Barrel-Aged Guatemala. Together, they yield beautiful notes of berry jam, chocolate truffle, and red wine. It’s a soul-warming cup of seasonal cheer that is virtually guaranteed to increase even the Grinch-iest of hearts by a minimum of three sizes."
